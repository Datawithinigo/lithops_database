# PostgreSQL Database in Lithops Database Project

This project uses a PostgreSQL database with SQLAlchemy as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to store and manage processor data. Here's how it works:

## Database Structure

The database has a single table called `processors` with the following fields:

- `id`: Integer, primary key
- `product`: String, indexed (processor name)
- `status`: String (e.g., "Launched", "Discontinued")
- `release_date`: String (e.g., "Q1'23")
- `code_name`: String (e.g., "Sapphire Rapids")
- `cores`: Integer (number of cores)
- `threads`: Integer (number of threads)
- `lithography`: Float (in nm)
- `max_turbo_freq`: Float (in GHz)
- `base_freq`: Float (in GHz)
- `tdp`: Integer (in Watts)
- `cache`: Float (in MB)
- `cache_info`: String
- `max_memory_size`: Integer (in GB)
- `memory_types`: String (e.g., "DDR4, DDR5")
- `max_memory_speed`: Integer (in MHz)
- `integrated_graphics`: String

## Database Connection

The database connection is set up in `src/backend/database.py` using SQLAlchemy. The connection string is stored in a `.env` file (which is gitignored) and loaded using the `python-dotenv` package.

## Ways to Insert Data

There are two main ways to insert data into the database:

### 1. Using the CSV Upload Endpoint

The project provides a FastAPI endpoint at `/upload-csv/` that allows you to upload a CSV file with processor data. The endpoint parses the CSV and inserts the data into the database.

To use this method:
1. Open the `upload.html` file in a browser (or navigate to the upload page if the app is running)
2. Select a CSV file with processor data (the file should have headers matching the field names)
3. Click the "Upload" button

The CSV file should have columns that match the field names in the database. You can see an example of the expected format in `src/resources/intel_xeon_processors_v1_8.csv`.

### 2. Using Python Code with SQLAlchemy

You can also insert data programmatically using SQLAlchemy. Here's an example of how to insert a single processor:

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from src.backend.models import Processor
from src.backend.database import get_db

# Get a database session
db = next(get_db())

# Create a new processor
processor = Processor(
    product="Intel Xeon E-2286M",
    status="Launched",
    release_date="Q2'19",
    code_name="Coffee Lake",
    cores=8,
    threads=16,
    lithography=14.0,
    max_turbo_freq=5.0,
    base_freq=2.4,
    tdp=45,
    cache=16.0,
    cache_info="Intel Smart Cache",
    max_memory_size=128,
    memory_types="DDR4-2666, LPDDR3-2133",
    max_memory_speed=2666,
    integrated_graphics="Intel UHD Graphics P630"
)

# Add the processor to the database
db.add(processor)

# Commit the changes
db.commit()

# Close the session
db.close()
```

### 3. Using the FastAPI Endpoints

While there isn't a specific endpoint for adding a single processor in the current implementation, you could create one by adding a new endpoint to `src/backend/main.py`. For example:

```python
@app.post("/processors/", response_model=schemas.Processor)
def create_processor(processor: schemas.ProcessorBase, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_processor = models.Processor(**processor.dict())
    db.add(db_processor)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_processor)
    return db_processor
```

Then you could use this endpoint to add a processor by sending a POST request with the processor data in JSON format.

## Database Configuration

The database connection string is stored in a `.env` file and loaded using the `python-dotenv` package. The connection string should be in the format:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name
```

# SOLUTION 2: 
# Starting and Accessing the PostgreSQL Database

To use the Lithops Database project, you need to set up and start a PostgreSQL database, then run the FastAPI backend server. Here's a step-by-step guide:

## 1. Install PostgreSQL (if not already installed)

### On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

### On macOS (using Homebrew):
```bash
brew install postgresql
```

### On Windows:
Download and install from the [PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)

## 2. Start the PostgreSQL Service

### On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo service postgresql start
# or
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

### On macOS:
```bash
brew services start postgresql
```

### On Windows:
PostgreSQL should be running as a service after installation. If not, you can start it from the Services application.

## 3. Create the Database and User

The `.env` file shows that the application expects a database named `xeon_processors` with a user `user` and password `password`. Let's create them:

```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL as the postgres user
sudo -u postgres psql

# Inside the PostgreSQL prompt, create the user and database
CREATE USER "user" WITH PASSWORD 'password';
CREATE DATABASE xeon_processors;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE xeon_processors TO "user";

# Exit the PostgreSQL prompt
\q
```

## 4. Create the Database Tables

The application uses SQLAlchemy's `create_all()` method to create tables automatically when the FastAPI server starts. This is defined in `src/backend/main.py` with the line:

```python
models.Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
```

## 5. Start the FastAPI Backend Server

To start the FastAPI server, use the following command from the project root:

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment if you're using one
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# or
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

# Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn src.backend.main:app --reload
```

This will start the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## 6. Access the API

Once the server is running, you can:

- Access the API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- Use the upload form by opening `upload.html` in your browser
- Make API requests to endpoints like:
  - GET `http://127.0.0.1:8000/processors/` to list all processors
  - GET `http://127.0.0.1:8000/processors/{id}` to get a specific processor
  - GET `http://127.0.0.1:8000/processor/tdp/{processor_name}` to get the TDP of a specific processor

## 7. Insert Data into the Database

### Using the CSV Upload Form:
1. Open `upload.html` in your browser
2. Select the CSV file (e.g., `src/resources/intel_xeon_processors_v1_8.csv`)
3. Click "Upload"

### Using Python Code:
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from src.backend.models import Processor, Base

# Connect to the database
engine = create_engine("postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/xeon_processors")
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)
db = SessionLocal()

# Create a new processor
new_processor = Processor(
    product="Intel Xeon E-2286M",
    status="Launched",
    release_date="Q2'19",
    code_name="Coffee Lake",
    cores=8,
    threads=16,
    lithography=14.0,
    max_turbo_freq=5.0,
    base_freq=2.4,
    tdp=45,
    cache=16.0,
    cache_info="Intel Smart Cache",
    max_memory_size=128,
    memory_types="DDR4-2666, LPDDR3-2133",
    max_memory_speed=2666,
    integrated_graphics="Intel UHD Graphics P630"
)

# Add and commit
db.add(new_processor)
db.commit()
db.close()
```

## 8. Start the Frontend (Optional)

If you want to use the Astro frontend:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

This will start the Astro frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Troubleshooting

- If you get a connection error, make sure PostgreSQL is running and the credentials in `.env` match your setup.
- If tables aren't created automatically, you can create them manually using SQLAlchemy:
  ```python
  from src.backend.database import engine
  from src.backend.models import Base
  Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
  ```
- If you're having permission issues with PostgreSQL, make sure the user has the correct privileges.

**Assistant:**

Now I have a good understanding of the database setup. Let me summarize what I've found and explain how you can change the database:

I've found where the app is pointing to the Intel processor database and how you can change it:

1. The app is currently pointing to a PostgreSQL database called "xeon_processors" as defined in your `.env` file:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/xeon_processors
   ```

2. This database URL is loaded in `src/backend/database.py` using the dotenv package, which reads the `.env` file and sets up the SQLAlchemy engine with this connection string.

3. The database schema is defined in `src/backend/models.py`, which has a `Processor` model that maps to the "processors" table.

4. There's also a script at `src/database_modification/create_base_database.py` that appears to be used for creating and populating a different database called "intel_processors" with data from CSV files in the `src/resources/v1_8` directory.

To change the database the app is pointing to, you have two options:

1. **Edit the .env file**: Simply modify the DATABASE_URL in your `.env` file to point to a different database. For example:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/intel_processors
   ```

2. **Create a new database**: If you want to create a new database with different data, you can:
   - Modify and run the `create_base_database.py` script to create a new database with your desired structure
   - Update the `.env` file to point to your new database

The current setup suggests that the app was originally designed to work with a database containing Intel Xeon processors specifically, but the database creation script is set up to import data from any CSV files in the resources directory.




# API QUERIES: 

Yes, you can access the database from another program or code through API requests. Your FastAPI application already has several endpoints set up for this purpose. Here's how you can do it:

## Available API Endpoints

Based on your `src/backend/main.py` file, the following endpoints are available:

1. **Get all processors**:
   ```
   GET http://localhost:8000/processors/
   ```
   - Optional query parameters: `skip` (default: 0) and `limit` (default: 100)
   - Returns a list of processors in JSON format

2. **Get processor TDP (plain text response)**:
   ```
   GET http://localhost:8000/processor/tdp/{processor_name}
   ```
   - Returns a plain text response with the TDP information

3. **Get processor TDP (JSON response)**:
   ```
   GET http://localhost:8000/api/processor/tdp/{processor_name}
   ```
   - Returns a JSON response with processor name and TDP

4. **Get processor by ID**:
   ```
   GET http://localhost:8000/processors/{processor_id}
   ```
   - Returns a specific processor by its ID in JSON format

5. **Upload CSV data**:
   ```
   POST http://localhost:8000/upload-csv/
   ```
   - Allows uploading CSV data to add processors to the database

## Example: Making API Requests in Python

Your `test_api.py` file already shows an example of how to make a request:

```python
import requests

# Get TDP information for a specific processor
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/processor/tdp/Xeon%20Bronze%203508U")
print("Status code:", response.status_code)
print("Response content:", response.text)

# For JSON responses, you can parse the response
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/api/processor/tdp/Xeon%20Bronze%203508U")
data = response.json()
print(data)  # This will print a dictionary with 'processor' and 'tdp' keys

# Get all processors
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/processors/")
all_processors = response.json()
print(f"Found {len(all_processors)} processors")

# Get a specific processor by ID
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/processors/1")
processor = response.json()
print(processor)
```

## Example: Making API Requests in JavaScript

```javascript
// Using fetch API
fetch('http://localhost:8000/processors/')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log(`Found ${data.length} processors`);
    console.log(data);
  });

// Get processor TDP
fetch('http://localhost:8000/api/processor/tdp/Xeon%20Bronze%203508U')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log(`The TDP of ${data.processor} is ${data.tdp} watts`);
  });
```

## Example: Using cURL from Command Line

```bash
# Get all processors
curl http://localhost:8000/processors/

# Get processor TDP
curl http://localhost:8000/processor/tdp/Xeon%20Bronze%203508U

# Get processor TDP in JSON format
curl http://localhost:8000/api/processor/tdp/Xeon%20Bronze%203508U
```

Remember that your FastAPI server must be running with the command `uvicorn src.backend.main:app --reload` for these API requests to work. The server will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000` by default.

If you need to access the API from a different machine, you'll need to make sure the server is bound to a public IP address (using `--host 0.0.0.0`) and that any firewalls allow the connection.
